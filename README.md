The default consistency level for COSMOSDB database is session consistency. The host and access secret/key needs to be set up as environment variables for local testing and Global environment variables when App is pushed, built and deployed in Azure Red Hat OpenShift environment Two environment variables name are COSMOS_HOST and COSMOS_MASTER_KEYThis demo API is using CosmosDB as backend database
